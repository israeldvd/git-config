## Git configuration

This repository has the purpose of showing current git **global configuration** for author's common repositories. The contents of the file [`list`](./list) can be copied, then, to the `config` file.

- Use `git config --global --edit`.

The file name, `list`, is set to be different than `.gitconfig` (config file) to avoid confusion with it thereafter, specially after copying it. Its name is arbitrary, though.
