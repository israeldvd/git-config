## Git configuration

This repository has the purpose of showing current git **global configuration** for author's common repositories. The contents of the file [`list`](./list) can be copied, then, to the `config` file.

-   Use `git config --global --edit`.

The file name, `list` is decided arbitrarily to be different than `.gitconfig` (config file) to avoid confusion with it, specially after copying it.

### Some non-trivial commands

-   `git lol` and `git lola`: these alias output an one-liner graphed-version of the `git log`, which can very useful.
    -   As a side note, a simpler version of it is found in the book Pro Git as an example.
